### Development status

I've added everything I wanted to add for my personal needs. If requested, I can add more features, but unless I come up with more ideas on functionalities or find bugs while using it, the development will be on pause for now.

Adding a monthly income, then as you spend keeping track of the expense, that gets subtracted from your total amount.
